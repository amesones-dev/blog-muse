Audience: 
* You want to start using CI/CD procedures in Google Cloud Platform.
* You are familiar with CI procedures.
* You are familiar with gcloud, git,  docker, python.
* You want to start coding *without any costs* for now. 

## CI basics
Following  last post [CI basics: creating build from a git branch (1/3)](/blog/jekyll/update/2023/08/09/CI-intro-build), 
in this guide we will complete the example script  whilst exploring related 
[CI](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration) principles. The example script is 
a minimal implementation of a build that creates artifacts from a repo branch, which is the first step needed to create 
an automated build process, one of CI building blocks. 
* At the moment, the script is a manual procedure, so we can inspect the several steps and relate them to CI principles.
* We will later inspect how to make it automatic and in sync with changes to the git branch code created by code developers.


## Previously...
We showed how a CI automated systems would provide the inputs for the build process: repo and branch information 
```shell
REPO='https://github.com/amesones-dev/gfs-log-manager.git'
REPO_NAME='gfs-log-manage'
export FEATURE_BRANCH="ci_procs"
```
The build process would :
* clone the repo and checkout specific branch
* identify the build to maintain a Builds database
* launch, execute and collect build results: status, logs, artifacts
* identify the generated artifacts to stored them in artifact registries and associate them to specific builds

```shell
export BUILD_ID=$(python -c "import uuid;print(uuid.uuid4())")
export LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG="${REPO_NAME}-${FEATURE_BRANCH}-${RID}"
```

The last step we inspected was how to check the generated artifacts. In this case, as an example, the single-step build 
produces a single docker image, that can be run with docker engine.
The docker was up and running and could be inspected with Web Preview on Cloud Shell.
```shell
docker run -e PORT -e LG_SA_KEY_JSON_FILE -e FLASK_SECRET_KEY -p ${PORT}:${PORT}  -v "${LOCAL_SA_KEY_PATH}":/etc/secrets  ${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG}
```


## About testing
So far, there have not been any execution errors (it can be checked with the build logs). But, is this enough to 
consider the build successful?

* Part of the CI process involves designing a number of conditions or checkpoints for the build products to be 
considered a valid input for successive CI processes. Generally speaking, tests are procedures that check that these 
conditions are met.  
* In the developing world, the word *'test'* has a specific meaning and usually refers to pieces of code included with 
the branch code itself, that use well-known testing methods and libraries and are designed to be used as input to 
standard and ideally automated testing procedures. There are code integrated tests of several kinds that apply to 
different phases of the build process in particular and the CI process in general.

**Test, what test?**  
In a fast-paced development environment developers are constantly updating code. A change of the branch code  can break
the build in  several  ways:
* The build system cannot fetch the code 
* The build  does not run successfully
* The build runs but the application does not respond
* The build runs but application does not do what is supposed to do.
* etc.  
There are tests that check most of these scenarios during the CI process. 
For a detailed look, check the reference links below.

## Making tests an integral part of the build
Since tests can be coded and are required to check that a build is successful, the next logical step is making the tests
an essential part of the code and the build process, including along the source code a number of tests that can be 
integrated  into the build process.  
  
* Everytime one of the developers makes a contribution to a branch, the tests are run before the build starts. This procedure 
helps to guarantee that the new code syntax is correct and the designed functionality is achieved, making this process 
fundamental for CI.
* Passing the tests phase becomes a condition for a build to progress and be considered a valid input for further CI processes.
* If the tests are not successful the overall Build process should fail and provide information. CI is by design iterative and uses detailed sub-processes feedback and registered status to avoid needless repetition.  

 From the wide variety of tests available, one type that fits this pattern particularly well is *Unit tests*.

### Brief introduction to Unit tests  
Unit tests are tests that check the application foundational units integrity and functionality. In a typical objects 
oriented programming application, it refers to checking that functions and classes code has no errors and that the 
functions behave as expected. 
To check that a piece of code provides the expected designed functionality, the tests check a battery of logical 
assertions based on the results expected given certain inputs.

```python
    # Check logging client initialization
        self.assertNotEqual(self.gl.client, None)
        self.assertTrue(self.gl.initialized())
```

## Introducing testing
As an example, a brief implementation of how testing can be introduced in the manual script examined so far.  
In this case, the set of tests used are unit tests. The Dockerfile used for the build is slightly modified to run the 
tests on the branch code before building.  
[Dockerfile for tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amesones-dev/gfs-log-manager/ci_procs/run/Dockerfile-tests).  
It shows how the same branch code that will be used for the build itself is the tests target.  
```
...
# Copy sources and tests into the container at /app
COPY src/. .
COPY tests/. .
...
# Run tests when the container launches
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "tests.py"]
...
```


### Build inputs
```shell
REPO='https://github.com/amesones-dev/gfs-log-manager.git'
REPO_NAME='gfs-log-manager'
export FEATURE_BRANCH="ci_procs"

# Provide Build ID and identify generated artifacts
export BUILD_ID=$(python -c "import uuid;print(uuid.uuid4())")
export RID="${RANDOM}-$(date +%s)" 
export LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG="${REPO_NAME}-${FEATURE_BRANCH}-${RID}"

# Provide Test ID and identify generated artifacts
export TID=$(python -c "import uuid;print(uuid.uuid4())")
export LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG_TEST="test-${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG}"
```
### Build process  

#### Checkout branch
```shell

git clone ${REPO}
cd ${REPO_NAME}
git checkout ${FEATURE_BRANCH}
```
#### Automated testing
```shell
# Create a docker image with the branch code that run the code built-in tests
# Generates a new artifact (docker image) that can be stored in an artifact repository as part of the build output    
docker build . -f ./run/Dockerfile-test   -t ${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG_TEST}  --no-cache --progress=plain  2>&1 | tee ${TEST_ID}.log

# Run tests
# Run image and check that tests are successful. 
# You may want to use a different set of environment variables to run tests
# Alternatively, code built-in tests can use a specific configuration defined inline.
docker run -e LG_SA_KEY_JSON_FILE -e FLASK_SECRET_KEY -v "${LOCAL_SA_KEY_PATH}":/etc/secrets ${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG_TEST} 2>&1 | tee ${TEST_ID}-result.log
# Output
  test_0_gl_creation_check (__main__.GlogManagerTestCase) ... ok
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 1 test in 0.262s
  OK
  
# Usually the output or logs are examined to determine success status
  grep 'OK' ""${TEST_ID}-result.log""    
```
 
#### Build  
```shell

docker build . -f ./run/Dockerfile -t ${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG} --no-cache --progress=plain  2>&1 | tee ${BUILD_ID}.log

export PORT=8081
export LG_SA_KEY_JSON_FILE='/etc/secrets/sa_key_lg.json'
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 128) 
export LOCAL_SA_KEY_PATH='/secure_location'

docker run -e PORT -e LG_SA_KEY_JSON_FILE -e FLASK_SECRET_KEY -p ${PORT}:${PORT}  -v "${LOCAL_SA_KEY_PATH}":/etc/secrets  ${LOCAL_DOCKER_IMG_TAG}
```

 

## Frameworks and tools for test automation 
As alternatives to the tests used in the example, here is a minimal list of python libraries and tools for test 
automation.  

**Unit tests runners**  
* [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
* [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

**Testing for Web applications**  
Web applications can be seen as a set of  multiple endpoints, but also they can be considered in terms of possible user 
journeys. The following tools allow testing lists of endpoints and simulating and automating user journeys in modern 
browsers:
* [Robot](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework)
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
